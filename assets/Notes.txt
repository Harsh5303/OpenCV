OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. 
It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

TUTORIAL 1:
- when you load image it extracts pixels and convert it into numpy array
blue green red


TUTORIAL 2:
[0,   0,   0] -> black color, [255, 255, 255] -> white color
0-255 -> color range(0 means - no color , 255 means - blue , in b/w means light blue)
RedGreenBlue - general case but BlueGreenRed - opencv

3x3 image:
[
    [ [ pixel values] --->col. of image ,[]     ,     []] -> row of image
    [[],[],[]]
    [[],[],[]]
]
image representation in numpy array: all pixels in col. -> all col. in rows -> you have multiple rows

so we can rotate by manipulating array without using cv2 library

print(img[257][400]) -> 257th row and mei 400th coln will be a pixel containing 3 values(if read at cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
